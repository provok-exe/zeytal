# Zeytal Basic Setup

Here’s the simplest [Zeytal](https://zeytal.com) project setup you can find.

## How to use

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample` with your Zeytal project secret key inside.
1. Install the `package.json` dependencies using `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.
1. Execute [`zeytal`](https://npmjs.com/package/zeytal) commands like so:

```bash
npm x zeytal generate
```

```bash
yarn zeytal generate
```

```bash
pnpm zeytal generate
```

The CLI will extract and transform data based on the Figma source files you provide in your project’s dashboard.

## What this example does

“Zeytal basic setup” is an example of the most rudimental Zeytal CLI configuration.

Your `zeytal.json` config file is ready to be updated with your tweaks. However, nothing has been overridden yet for the beginning of your project.
